Creative Portion:

For our creative portion we worked on implementing a Reddit clone. Basically stories can be added under a community, these stories can be viewed by community. Each user can vote once on a story, you can sort stories by popularity, unpopularity, or recency.

Creative Part 1: Groups. Able to create groups, join groups, post stories to only groups you are in. Able to sort stories by groups.

Creative Part 2: Upvotes. You can see how many upvotes (can be negative) a story has. You are also able to sort based on most popular, and least poular.


Git Commit History:

My partner and I got started on this module before there was an official repo released on Piazza. We pushed all of the changes to our own private repository which we set up.
When uploading to the official assignment repository we just copy and pasted the files over and uploaded them all at once. We do actually have commit history, see m3_commit_history.jpg:

If you need to see the full commit history, we can add you to our private repository.
